The pickup point selector app adds a block to your store, which allows shoppers to add a product to cart and select a pickup point for it with a single action.

The app creates a list of available pickup points by running a simulation with the selected SKU and the zipcode provoded by the shopper.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This app should only be used inside the product page, since one of its dependencies is the `product-context`.

## Configuration

Follow the steps below to configure the app on your store theme.

### 1. Install the app in your workspace and account.

To do this, you can go to the [Pickup point selector page](https://apps.vtex.com/vtexbr-pickup-selector/p) in the VTEX app store or run this command in your terminal:
```bash
vtex install vtexbr.pickup-selector
```

### 2. Add the app as a theme dependency in the `manifest.json` file.

See an example of how to do this:
```json
  "peerDependencies": {
    "vtexbr.pickup-selector": "2.x"
  }
```

Now, you are able to use all the [blocks](#blocks) exported by the **pickup-selector** app and its respective [props](#props).

### 3. Adding the main block

Declare the app's main block in a given theme template or inside another block from the theme. See the code example below.

```json
  "pickup-selector": {
    "children": [
      "pickup-selector-zipcode-input",
      "pickup-selector-search-sla-button",
      "pickup-selector-sla-list"
    ]
  }
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note that the [blocks](#blocks) `pickup-selector-zipcode-input`, `pickup-selector-search-sla-button` and `pickup-selector-sla-list` are required inside the main block. But you can use them in any order you want. You can also use flex-layout if needed.

### 4. Configuring the `pickup-selector-sla-list`

The only [block](#blocks) that should be used inside this one is the `pickup-selector-option-card`. We do this so that you can be free to style the option card as you want, and we will use that as a template for all the options. Below you can see an example.

```json
  "pickup-selector-sla-list": {
    "children": [
      "pickup-selector-option-card"
    ]
  }
```

### 5. Configuring the `pickup-selector-option-card`

You are free to style this block as you wish.

The app provides [blocks](#blocks) that will help with the information about the pickup point. They are the following:

- `pickup-selector-option-card-pickup-point-name`
- `pickup-selector-option-card-pickup-point-address`
- `pickup-selector-option-card-pickup-point-distance`
- `pickup-selector-option-card-pickup-point-sla`

The only mandatory block inside this one is the `pickup-selector-option-card-add-product-button`.

Below you can see and example of this:

```json
  "pickup-selector-option-card": {
    "children": [
      "flex-layout.col#card-container"
    ]
  },

  "flex-layout.col#card-container": {
    "children": [
      "flex-layout.row#card-header",
      "product-separator",
      "flex-layout.row#card-body"
    ]
  },

  "flex-layout.row#card-header": {
    "props": {
      "colSizing": "auto"
    },
    "children": [
      "pickup-selector-option-card-pickup-point-distance",
      "pickup-selector-option-card-pickup-point-name"
    ]
  },

  "flex-layout.row#card-body": {
    "props": {
      "colSizing": "auto"
    },
    "children": [
      "flex-layout.col#card-body-address",
      "flex-layout.col#card-body-call-to-action"
    ]
  },

  "flex-layout.col#card-body-address": {
    "children": [
      "pickup-selector-option-card-pickup-point-address"
    ]
  },

  "flex-layout.col#card-body-call-to-action": {
    "children":[
      "pickup-selector-option-card-pickup-point-sla",
      "pickup-selector-option-card-add-product-button"
    ]
  }
```

Using the configuration above, the end result would look like this:
